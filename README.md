# Project Report: E-Commerce Supply Chain Analysis

**Introduction:**
The objective of this project is to analyze the supply chain data from the provided dataset, "E-Commerce Supply Chain.csv". The dataset contains information about product types, SKUs, pricing, availability, sales, revenue, customer demographics, stock levels, shipping details, manufacturing information, transportation modes, routes, costs, and defect rates. The analysis aims to provide insights into sales performance, revenue generation, shipping costs, defect rates, and other key metrics related to the supply chain.

**Data Source:**
The dataset used for analysis is "E-Commerce Supply Chain.csv". It contains various columns such as Product type, SKU, Price, Availability, Number of products sold, Revenue generated, Customer demographics, Stock levels, Lead times, Order quantities, Shipping times, Shipping carriers, Shipping costs, Supplier name, Location, Manufacturing lead time, Manufacturing costs, Inspection results, Defect rates, Transportation modes, Routes, and Costs.

**Analysis:**

1. **Price vs. Revenue Analysis:**
   - A scatter plot was generated to analyze the relationship between the price of the product and the revenue generated. It included trendlines to visualize any linear relationships between price and revenue.

2. **Sales by Product Type:**
   - The total number of products sold was aggregated by product type (cosmetics, haircare, skincare), and a pie chart was created to show the distribution of sales across different product types.

3. **Revenue by Shipping Carriers:**
   - The total revenue generated was aggregated by shipping carriers (Carrier A, Carrier B, Carrier C), and a bar chart was created to visualize the revenue generated by each shipping carrier.

4. **Revenue generated by each SKU:**
   - A line chart was generated to visualize the revenue generated by each SKU, providing insights into the performance of individual products.

5. **Order Quantity of each SKU:**
   - A line chart was generated to visualize the order quantity of each SKU, providing insights into the demand for individual products.

6. **Shipping Costs of Carriers:**
   - A bar chart was generated to visualize the shipping costs associated with each shipping carrier, providing insights into the distribution of shipping costs.

7. **Cost Distribution of Transportation Mode:**
   - A pie chart was generated to visualize the distribution of costs across different transportation modes, providing insights into the cost distribution in the supply chain.

8. **Defect Rate during Shipping:**
   - The average defect rate during shipping was calculated for each product type, and a bar chart was created to visualize the defect rates, providing insights into the quality of shipping for different product types.

**Conclusion:**
The analysis of the supply chain data provides valuable insights into sales performance, revenue generation, shipping costs, defect rates, and other key metrics. These insights can be used by businesses to optimize their supply chain processes, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.

**Note:**
The code for data preprocessing and analysis is provided in both PDF and CSV formats for reference. The project repository on GitHub contains the dataset, code files, and this report for further exploration and collaboration.
